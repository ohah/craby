# CLI Commands

This guide covers the Craby CLI commands for project initialization, code generation, and building.

**Overview**

Craby provides a CLI tool called `crabygen` for managing your native modules:

```bash
npx crabygen <command> [options]
```

::: info
You can also use the `craby` command instead of `crabygen` (they are aliases).

## `init`

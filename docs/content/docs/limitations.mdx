title: Limitations
---

Craby is designed for performance-critical pure computation modules and has the following limitations

## Platform-Specific Features

Craby does not support platform-specific APIs that require direct access to native platform capabilities, such as:

- Camera, microphone, and sensor access
- Native UI components and view managers
- Platform-specific services (e.g., location services, notifications, background tasks)
- Direct integration with platform SDKs (e.g., ARKit, MLKit, Firebase native modules)

<Callout>
  App data I/O (File I/O) operations are fully supported in Craby. For more details, refer to the [File IO guide](/docs/guides/file-io).
</Callout>

## TurboModule Features

Certain standard TurboModule capabilities are not supported:

- Event emitters (`NativeEventEmitter`)
- Platform context access (e.g., `Context` on Android, `UIApplication` on iOS)
- Native module lifecycle callbacks
- Direct access to React Native bridge APIs

<Callout>
  Craby provides [Signals](/docs/guides/signals) as an alternative for one-way native-to-JavaScript event notifications. While Signals don't carry data payloads, they enable triggering callbacks from Rust to JavaScript.
